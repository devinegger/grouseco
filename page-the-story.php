                <h3>DISCOVERY</h3>

                <p>Hi I’m Twila Henley and I founded Grouse Artisan Malt when my life was interrupted with crippling daily pain and diagnoses of an auto-immune disease called Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Similar to Crohn’s disease and Celiac disease, UC is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that triggers an immune response in the digestive system.</p>

                <p>UC causes a multitude of not so discreet symptoms including nausea, weight loss, diarrhea, fatigue, and more. I was doomed to the confines of prescription medication—this being presented as the only solution.</p>

                <p>Then life took an interesting twist. While searching for healthy alternatives and remedies I learned about the gluten&mdash;free lifestyle. It seemed alright at first, but it lacked one major component—a tasty gluten-free beer. As I sampled glass after glass I was sadly disgusted by its flavor.</p>

                <p>I thought &mdash; 'Is it too much to ask for a delicious gluten&mdash;free beer?'</p>

                <p>The idea was challenging, and it became my personal goal to create an awesome tasting beer that just so happens to also be gluten&mdash;free.</p>

                <h3>CREATION</h3>

                <p>I reached out to local farmers growing gluten&mdash;free grains. I visited craft maltsters and brewers to learn the fine trade of malting and brewing. I experimented. A bunch.</p>
                
                <p>And along the way I committed to the decision to become totally gluten&mdash;free, and it changed my life forever.</p>

                <p>The results, as we’re sure you have heard from others, are staggering. To be free from the anti&mdash;inflammatory, immune suppressors, and other medications used to control UC is just the beginning.</p>
                
                <p>My fortune at discovering a natural solution to this medical problem doesn’t escape me. It made me realize that I truly wanted to provide people viable options to live a life free from medications caused by food allergies and intolerances.</p>

                <p>Providing gluten&mdash;free malts so brewers can make an awesome tasting gluten&mdash;free beer is just the beginning of this story.</p>

                <p>Welcome the world of healthy indulgences. Welcome to the Grouse Malt House.</p>
